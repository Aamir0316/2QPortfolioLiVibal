        <h3>1. Be confident in entering the site first!</h3>
        <h4>Don't wait for your teammates to start getting mad at you. Make sure you are brave and confident in you abilities and make a leeway for ur team to go in.</h4>
        <h3>2. Don't bait your teammates.</h3>
        <h4>The last thing you want to do as a duelist is bait your teammates. It's dishonorful to choose an agent and not follow it's roles. Instead go in first, clear corners and always stay in front!</h3>
        <h3>3. Communicate and plan with your team</h3>
        <h4>As a duelist, you're job is to enter site first. However, without the help of your team, this is almost impossible. Communicate with your team and tell them which angles you'll be clearing or direction you're entering.</h4>
